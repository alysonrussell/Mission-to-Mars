# Mission-to-Mars

## Web Scraping Challenge
This web app scrapes different resources about Mars and presents them together in one place.  Softwares used include BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB, Flask, and Bootstrap.

## Portfolio Creation
In this module we also used templates to start a professional portfolio.  My portfolio can be found in a GitHub repository found at: github.com/alysonrussell/portfolio.  See a preview of the portfolio below.
